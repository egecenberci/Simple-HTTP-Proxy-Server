# Simple-HTTP-Proxy-Server
My submission for Bilkent's CS 421 Computer Networks course's programming assignment.

The assignment required us to create a proxy server that processed and handled HTTP requests that were received from a specified port by the user.
This repository does not include the assignment's file to preserve academic integrity.

The report's first section includes the results gathered while testing Netcat's functionalities with the given constraints. The second section goes through the code of the proxy server and makes explanations as required.
